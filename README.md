# hello-formik

A basic form that uses Formik for state and validation.

Use a single command to clone, build, and run (must have `git`, `node`, `yarn`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryyya/hello-formik \
  && cd hello-formik                             \
  && yarn                                        \
  && yarn start
```
